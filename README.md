# Infraport

This application aims to combat the infrastructural issues in our local community. By compiling information regarding the location of problems such as potholes and obstructions, we will be able to alert the corresponding jurisdiction of these issues and facilitate the creation of a safer and more enjoyable living environment. This would allow local governments and communities to work together to fix problems in infrastructure.
